# Image-to-Text Generation using CNN and LSTM

## Overview
This project implements an image captioning model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to extract visual features and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** to generate descriptive captions. The combined architecture enables accurate and meaningful text descriptions of images.

## Features
- **CNN-based Feature Extraction**: Extracts high-level visual features from images.
- **LSTM-based Caption Generation**: Uses image features and prior word predictions to generate coherent descriptions.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Processes images and produces captions efficiently.
- **Trained on Large Datasets**: Improves accuracy and generalization for diverse images.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning-cnn-lstm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-captioning-cnn-lstm
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script to generate captions:
   ```bash
   python generate_caption.py --image_path example.jpg
   ```
2. The output will display the generated caption for the given image.

## Model Architecture
- **CNN** (e.g., ResNet or Inception) for extracting image features.
- **LSTM** for sequential text generation.
- **Embedding Layers** for word representations.
- **Attention Mechanisms** (optional) for enhanced caption accuracy.

## Dataset
The model is trained on image-caption pairs from datasets like **MS COCO**, **Flickr8k**, or **Flickr30k** to improve performance.

## Results
The model achieves **high accuracy in generating relevant captions**. Example outputs:
